    title: 'Revolutionizing Architectural Design and Visualization',
    objective: 'Develop a comprehensive AR/VR solution for visualizing large-scale architectural projects in real-world contexts.',
    background: 'Current architectural visualization techniques rely heavily on 2D plans and small-scale models, which do not fully convey the spatial experience of a design. AR/VR can enable architects and clients to explore full-scale, immersive models of buildings within their intended environments.',

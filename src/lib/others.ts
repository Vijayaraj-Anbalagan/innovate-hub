      title: 'Developing an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System for Code-Mixed Tamil-English Language',
      objective: 'Create an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that can accurately transcribe code-mixed Tamil-English speech. The goal is to improve transcription accuracy for audio recordings where speakers frequently switch between Tamil and English within a single sentence.',
      background: 'Code-mixing, the practice of alternating between two or more languages within a conversation, is common in many multilingual communities. Existing ASR systems often struggle to accurately transcribe code-mixed speech, leading to significant errors. An effective ASR system for code-mixed Tamil-English speech would be highly beneficial for various applications, including automated subtitling, voice-activated assistants, and educational tools.',
